This repository holds assignment(s) completed at Southern New Hampshire University term 22EW5 for CS210-T5555 Programming Languages.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Program to analyze grocery text documents that contain records of daily items purchased.  The program utilizes C++ and Python. It performs three main functions - Produces a list of all items purchased in a day along with an integer count of each time that item was purchased, capability to search a single item to display the number of times that item was purchased that day, and produce an histogram of all items in a day.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code to write would be the error handling for the main function. I had to do a research on stack overflow and read some documentation to figure this out. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Integrating two languages, C++ and Python, into one project will be something that will be very useful in other projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By modularizing the code into different classes and adding comments to explain the function of the code I was able to make the program more maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
